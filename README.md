python-csr-generator
====================

I couldn't find a pure python Certificate Signing Request generator, so I made one.


(when I get some time I'll actually clean this up and commit it, for now you can find it in <https://github.com/volcanicpixels/volcanicpixels/blob/new/volcanicpixels/ssl/csr.py>)
